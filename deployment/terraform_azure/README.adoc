= Deploying this application on Azure

== Running Terraform

Login to Azure":

```
az login # or equivalent
```

Run Terraform:

```
deployment/terraform_azure/terraform_azure-apply.sh
```

== Deploying services to k8s

```
./deployment/terraform_azure/terraform_azure-k8s-deploy.sh
```

This script starts the services, incrementally and waits for pods to be come ready in order to avoid restarts.

== Getting the public IP address

Once the applications are deployed to AKS, get LoadBalancer external IP addresses of nginx by running -

```
KUBECONFIG=./deployment/terraform_azure/aks_kubectl_config kubectl get svc -n nginx-ingress
```

== Testing the deployment

You can test by running:

```
./deployment/terraform_azure/invoke-api.sh
```

=== Cleaning up

Delete the main Kubernetes resources:

```
./deployment/terraform_azure/terraform_azure-k8s-delete.sh
```

Delete the Ingress Controller

```
 ./deployment/terraform_azure/terraform_azure-k8s-delete-ingress-controller.sh
```

Destroy the Terraform resources

```
 ./deployment/terraform_azure/terraform_azure-destroy.sh
```
